        <p className="text-lg">
          Since my early childhood days, my passion for experimentation and innovation was evident as I played the role of a &quot;mad scientist.&quot; As I grew older, this inclination naturally evolved into programming, where lines of code became my new medium for creating and innovating. Choosing programming wasn&rsquo;t just a shift in direction; it was a continuation of the essence of my quest for unique solutions. Each programming project is a growth experience, where I see my ideas come to life digitally. Thus, programming has become the modern expression of the creativity that drove me since childhood, transforming me from an imaginative &quot;mad scientist&quot; into a accomplished programmer.

          I began my journey with an internship at the Ministry of Sports, contributing to the development of a social network for athletes sponsored by the government. Primarily focusing on the backend using TypeORM, I also assisted colleagues in learning ReactJS during the 8 months on this project. Subsequently, I joined the MBL - Free Brazil Movement, where over 8 months, I participated in various projects, refining my skills and knowledge in a collaborative and challenging environment. This journey has been crucial for my rapid development, propelled by the constant exchange of experiences with dedicated colleagues.
